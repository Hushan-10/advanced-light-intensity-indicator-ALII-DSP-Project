# 🌟 Task 1: Real-Time Light Monitoring System  

This project implements a **real-time light monitoring system** using a **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)** sensor and a **seven-segment display**.  
The system continuously measures ambient light intensity and displays the corresponding level in the range **0–7**, where:  

- **0** → Lowest light level  
- **7** → Highest light level  

---

## 🔧 Features  
- 📡 **Real-Time Sensing**: Continuously monitors surrounding light intensity.  
- 🔦 **LDR-Based Detection**: Uses an **LDR sensor** for accurate light measurement.  
- 🔢 **Seven-Segment Display Output**: Displays values from `0` (dark) to `7` (bright).  
- ⚡ **Simple & Efficient**: Lightweight circuit design for quick response.
